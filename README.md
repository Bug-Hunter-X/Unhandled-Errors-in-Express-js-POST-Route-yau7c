# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in request processing.  The `bug.js` file shows a POST route that lacks essential error handling.  This can lead to application crashes or, worse, silent failures when requests contain malformed data or are missing required fields.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, demonstrating robust error handling to address these issues.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the necessary dependency.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with malformed JSON (e.g., missing a required field) using tools like Postman or curl. Observe the server's response or lack thereof.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking incoming requests for errors.  This includes validating the request body's structure and ensuring all required fields are present.  Appropriate error handling should be implemented to gracefully return informative error messages to the client in case of problems.
